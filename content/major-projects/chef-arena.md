    Chef's Arena is a coding platform similar to other online judges, implemented in React.js which helps programmers to
    participate in ongoing CodeChef contests and creating virtual contests. Participants can see their CodeChef profile,
    ranks, recent submissions of any problem or contest, and also can run the code in IDE. This application uses the
